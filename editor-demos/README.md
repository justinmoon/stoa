# Editor Demos (Standalone)

These demos do **not** integrate with Stoa. They exist to evaluate editor stacks in isolation.

## Coding editor

- `codemirror/` — CodeMirror 6 demo (`./cm <file>`), saves on `Cmd+S`.

## Rich text (not for code)

- `prosemirror/` — ProseMirror demo (`./pm <file.pm.json>`). Kept around for rich-text experiments.
